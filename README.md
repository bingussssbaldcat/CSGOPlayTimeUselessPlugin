# CSGOPlayTimeUselessPlugin
The most stupid and shit plugin probably anyone will ever see.

Purpose of this 'plugin' is to display to a player/client that theyve been officially on the server for 3 hours exactly (customisable in .sp) aswell as says this specific message "You've Been Here for 3 Hours! Go Touch some grass xd"
but yeah is probably useless and i was bored.
